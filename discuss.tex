In this paper, we discuss the possibility of cross correlating kSZ signal with 
21cm intensity mapping as a new probe to study baryon distributions.
{\it yet never mention baryon distribution....} 
We present the correlation results after foreground substraction and high k cut off from simulations at redshift 1 and 2. 
We recover large scale information lost in foregrounds with a 3D tidal reconstruction and obtain a $r>0.6$ correlation for $l\sim100-2000$, 
and $S/N>3$ for $l\sim 500-3000$ with Planck noise. 
This shows a promising future for this method.
