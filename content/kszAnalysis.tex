We want to pinpoint the missing essential modes for generating kSZ signal. 

The first step is to clarify which angular scale of the kSZ signal 
we look at. 
As demonstrated in Fig.\ref{fig:CMB}, 
the kSZ effect is too faint to 
be distinguished until 
primary CMB starts to fade away, 
which is roughly $\ell>500$. 
It is possible to select a frequency band with thermal SZ signal negligible, 
then the dominate factor on high $\ell$ will be the CMB facility noises. 
Consider existing Planck \cite{Planck2015} data at 217 GHz, 
$\ell \sim 500-3000$ will be the visible window for kSZ signal. 
The window could be extended to higher frequency with 
ACTpol and CMB-S4. 


The next step is to understand what role each scale plays in generating kSZ signal 
at $\ell \sim 500-3000$. 
Write Eq.(\ref{eq:ksz}) in Fourier space. 
$\Theta(\bm{\ell})$ is propotional to the $k_z=0$ mode of the momentum field, 
given $g(\eta)$ varies slowly. 
%$p_\parallel(\bm{k})$. 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:thetak}
    \Theta(\bm{\ell})&\propto&p_\parallel({k}_x\chi,{k}_y\chi,0)\\
    &\propto&\int 
    d^3k^\prime\,\delta(\bm{\ell}/\chi-\bm{k}_\perp^\prime,k_\parallel^\prime) v_z(\bm{k^\prime})\nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}

The convolution of $\delta$ and $v_z$ 
indicates the signal comes from the cross talk of 
$\bm{\ell}/\chi-\bm{k}_\perp^\prime$ and $\bm{k}_\perp$, 
sum over all $k^\prime$. 

Since $v_z \propto k_z/k^3$, 
it drops fast at small scales. 
Boldly analogize $v_z$ to a Dirac delta function $\delta^D(\bm{k}^\prime)$, 
$\Theta(\bm{\ell})$ will reduce to $\propto\delta(\bm{\ell}/\chi,0) v_z(0,0)$, 
with integration of other $k^\prime$ negligible due to the faintness of 
$v_z(k^\prime\neq0)$. 
Although in reality, $v_z(\bm{k})$ 
wouldn't be as sharp as $\delta^D$, 
and the peak will be more close to 
($k_\perp$,$k_\parallel$)=($0.01$,$0.1$) h/Mpc 
rather than (0,0),
it is still safe to say 
that most of the kSZ signals are 
generated from the cross talk between a narrow box of 
$v_z(\bm{k})$ with k  
surrounding (0.01,0.1) h/Mpc 
and a narrow box of $\delta(k)$ with k close to 
$\delta(\bm{\ell}/\chi,0.1)$ h/Mpc. 
The essential modes for both fields are marked with 
red lines in Fig.\ref{fig:k3v}. 
Background color denote the contribution of $|\delta(k)|$ and $|v_z(k)|$ 
at different scales in Fourier transform. 
Comparing it with Fig.\ref{fig:21cm-CMB}, 
we notice that while the 
essential modes for $\delta$ are partly resolved, 
the large scale information dominating $v_z$ is 
almost completely drained out in 21 IM fields.

Therefore, the primary task to restore the cross correlation 
between kSZ and 21cm IM fields is to reconstruct the 
large scale modes for $v_z$.
