To avoid manipulating noises, 
we perform tidal reconstruction on most conservative estimates, i.e. 
$R_\parallel=15$ Mpc/h, $k_{max}=0.6$ h/Mpc, $\ell_{max}=100$ for $z=1$; 
$R_\parallel=10$ Mpc/h, $k_{max}=0.4$ h/Mpc, $\ell_{max}=100$ for $z=2$. 

The cross correlation between $\hat v_z^{tide}$ and $v_z$ are demonstrated in Fig.\ref{fig:v}. 
Important modes for velocity fields(within redline of Fig.\ref{fig:k3p} lower label) are well extracted with correlation greater than $0.7$. 
The reconstruction on $z=2$ is slightly worse than $z=1$ 
due to stronger foreground and lower resolution. 

Combining reconstructed velocity field with density fields of different conditions, we get mock kSZ signals. 
Their correlation coefficients with exact kSZ are 
demonstrated in Fig.\ref{fig:r}. 
Even with identical tidal reconstructed velocity field, 
better foreground techneque can improve the correlation coefficient by 0.2. 
If the foreground is removed clean enough for more modes to be 
used in tidal reconstruction procedure, 
the improvement will be more notable.
Resolution of facility will improve the reconstruction on higher $\ell$, 
consisting with previous analysis.
