To ressemble realistic observations, we take into account the resolution, small scale noises, foreground substractions 
and spatial loss of interferometers. 
Three filters are applied on original density contrast $\delta$ to imitate the effects of noise substractions:

1. For small scale noises:

Import a cut off scale $\ell_c$ 
with a step function $H(\ell_c-\ell)$. 
For $\ell>\ell_c$, $H(\ell_c-\ell)=0$; for $\ell\leqslant \ell_x$; $H(\ell_c-\ell)=1$.
This is reasonable for a single dish experiment, which
has good brightness sensitivity and an exponetially growing noise at small 
scales.
%With resolution $\ell_{max}=2\pi L_{longest}/\lambda_{obs}$
We choose $\ell_c\sim1150$, 
according to the longest baseline of ongoing experiments \cite{HIRAX,2014SPIE.9145E..22B,2014SPIE.9145E..4VN,2012IJMPS..12..256C,2015ApJ...798...40X}. 
We also present the result of case with $\ell_c=2300$, 
since total S/N will be largely increased in this case. 

2. For foreground noises:

Use a high pass filter $W_{fs}(k_\parallel)=1-e^{-k_\parallel^2R_\parallel^2/2}$ to imitate the substraction. 
We again test a worst case with 
$R_\parallel=15\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ for $z=1$ and $R_\parallel=8\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ for $z=2$, which gives
$W_{fs}=0.5$ at
$k_\parallel=0.08\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ and $0.15\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ respectively. 
And a good yet still realistic case \cite{15Shaw} with 
$R_\parallel=60\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ for $z=1$ and $R_\parallel=32\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ for $z=2$, which gives
$W_{fs}=0.5$ at
$k_\parallel=0.02\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ and $0.04\ \mr{Mpc}/h$. 
%This is realistic according to the condition of current 21 cm observations 
%\cite{2013ApJ...763L..20M,Switzer13}.

3. For spatial loss of inteferometries:

We choose  

The observed 21 cm field after noises subtraction is then given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ns}
\delta_{ns}(\bm{k})=\delta(\bm{k})W_{fs}(k_\parallel)H(k_c-k),
\end{eqnarray}

With the noise filtered density contrast $\delta_{ns}$, we follow the procedure described in 
section \ref{sec:kszRecon} to generate a mock kSZ signal $\hat \Theta_{ns}$  
and calculate cross correlation $r_{\Theta\hat\Theta_{ns}}$.
