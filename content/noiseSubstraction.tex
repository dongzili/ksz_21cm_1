As mentioned before, there are three main disadvantages for ongoing 21cm intensity mapping experiments: 
the relatively low resolution, 
the strong foreground noises 
and the spatial loss of interferometers. 
To discuss how they will influence the cross correlation kSZ, 
we reprocess the density contrasts obtained in simulation to 
assemble the loss. 

1. For small scale noises:

The finite spacial and velocity resolution of facilities 
prevent us from resolving infinitely small structures in both parallel and perpendicular directions. 
Therefore we import a cut off scale $k_{max}$ with a Heaviside Function 
$H(k_{max}-k)$, dropping all the modes with k larger than $k_{max}$. 
We choose a realistic $k_{max}$ based on baselines of ongoing experiments 
\cite{HIRAX,2014SPIE.9145E..22B,2014SPIE.9145E..4VN,2012IJMPS..12..256C,2015ApJ...798...40X}, 
and an ideal $k_{max}$ based on noise status of Planck Satellite.

2. For foreground noises:

Foregrounds coming from Galactic emissions, telescope noise, 
extragalactic radio sources and Radio recombination lines, 
could be three orders brighter than actual signals\cite{DiMatteo04,Masui13}. 
The process of foreground removal, taking advantage of its low spectral
degrees of freedom \cite{Switzer15}, 
will inevitably contaminates the smooth large scale structure in radial direction.  
To imitate the loss, a high pass filter $W_{fs}(k_\parallel)=1-e^{-k_\parallel^2R_\parallel^2/2}$ is applied to density contraction. 
We again test a realistic case \cite{2013ApJ...763L..20M,Switzer13}
with 
only half of the signal resolved at $k_\parallel=0.08$ Mpc/h and $0.15$ Mpc/h 
for redshift 1 and 2 respectively. 
And a theoretical case \cite{15Shaw} with half of the signal lost 
at $k_\parallel=0.02$ Mpc/h and $0.04$ Mpc/h for redshift 1 and 2. 
%$R_\parallel=15\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ for $z=1$ and $R_\parallel=8\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ for $z=2$, which gives
%$W_{fs}=0.5$ at
%$k_\parallel=0.08\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ and $0.15\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ respectively. 
%And a good yet still realistic case \cite{15Shaw} with 
%$R_\parallel=60\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ for $z=1$ and $R_\parallel=32\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ for $z=2$, which gives
%$W_{fs}=0.5$ at
%$k_\parallel=0.02\ \mr{Mpc}/h$ and $0.04\ \mr{Mpc}/h$. 
%This is realistic according to the condition of current 21 cm observations 
%\cite{2013ApJ...763L..20M,Switzer13}.

3. For spatial loss of inteferometers:

Large scale structure in perpendicular plane, due to the smoothness, 
will appear sharp in the visibility function of interferometers 
after Fourier Transformation. 
Unfortunately that sharp peak could not be resolved by interferometers 
due to the incomplete sampling  
caused by the finite length of the shortest baselines. 
Therefore, structures with angular sizes greater than a threshold of $l_{min}=300$ 
are assumed to be lost in our simulations. 
%We do not assume worse cases there, since baselines as short as 20m 
%are already able to filter most of the important modes for velocity reconstruction. 
We do not assume different cases here, 
since most of the important modes dropped can be retrieved using cosmic tidal reconstruction. 

In sum, the observed 21 cm density contrasts after all the loss will appear as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ns}
    \delta_{nf}(\bm{k})=\delta(\bm{k})H(k_{max}-k)W_{fs}(k_\parallel)H(l-l_{min}),
\end{eqnarray}
The detailed filtering parameters are presented in Table. \ref{tab:para}.

With the noise filtered density contrast $\delta_{nf}$, we follow the procedure described in
section \ref{sec:kszRecon} to generate a mock kSZ signal $\hat \Theta_{nf}$  
and calculate cross correlation $r_{\Theta\hat\Theta_{nf}}$.
