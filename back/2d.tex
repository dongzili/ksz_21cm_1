From Eq.(\ref{eq:k3d}) we can infer that the error of $\kappa_{3D}(\bm{x})$ is 
$\sigma_{k3d}(\bm{k})\propto(\frac{k^2}{k_\perp^2})^2$, where $k_\perp$ refers to modes that are tangental.
The anisotropy in $k_\perp$ and $k_\parallel$ is due to the discard of information about radial shear field.
To control the large noise corresponds to small $k_perp$, we apply filter to calculate the clean large scale density field$\hat \kappa_c$:
