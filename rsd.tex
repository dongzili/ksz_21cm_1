The redshift space distortion(rsd) refers to the misjudgement on comoving distance 
caused by peculiar velocity of objects. 
Here we study its influence on our reconstructions. 

%$\chi^{RSD}=\chi+\frac{v_z}{H}$, 
%where $\chi$ is the radial distance, $v_z$ is the parallel peculiar velocity.
Linearly the rsd will induce an additional contraction in z direction 
$\delta^{rsd}(\bm{k})=(1+f\frac{k_z^2}{k^2})\delta(\bm{k})$. 
We can easily substract it by dividing the observed density contrast with the additional term. 
The resulting bias $b=P_{\delta_rsd,\delta}/P_{\delta}$ is presented in 
Fig.\ref{fig:bias}. 

For z=2, until the cut off scale $k_c=0.32$ h/Mpc
the non-linear effect is still not very strong. 
However, for z=1, there are sufficient non-linear effects below $k_c=0.5$ h/Mpc. 
Cannot directly substract it, we go through identical procedures on redshift distorted fields, 
and see how much influence it exerts on cross correlation.
The result is presented in Fig.\ref{fig:r}. 

Much to our surprise, the cross correlation is even improved by 0.1. 
This is possibly because both rsd and foregrounds are in z direction. 
The contraction induced by rsd assigns more weigh to large $k_z$ modes, 
and these are the most clean signals survived from foregrounds.  
Moreover, rsd assigns more weigh to shear estimators related to covariance in z directions, 
and this is where best tidal recovered modes come from.  
Hence, the field with rsd accidentally give us better results on cross correlation.

This is not the only advantage rsd brings. 
Actually the inhancement in large $k_z$ will increase the S/N at that level, 
raise the cut off scale $k_c$ and ultimately improve the reconstruction results. 
In all, redshift space distortion seems to be a blessing rather than problem in our case.
